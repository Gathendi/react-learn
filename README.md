# React Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React Learning Journey**! This repository is where I document my daily progress as I learn **React**. Follow along as I dive deeper into React's core concepts and build projects along the way.

Each day, I update this with the new topics I've learned, challenges I've faced, and projects I've built. This is my way of mastering React one step at a time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended)
- A code editor like **VSCode**
- **Git** for version control
- Basic knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-learn.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-learn
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pnpm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

You're now ready to start exploring React!

## Learning Plan

Here's the roadmap I'll follow as I begin my React journey:

### 1. **React Basics**

- JSX syntax
- Functional Components
- Props

---

## Progress and Topics Learned

### Day 1: **Introduction to React and Components**

**What I Learned:**

- Learned JSX syntax and how it relates to HTML.
- Built my first functional component.
- Started exploring the project structure in a React app.

**Challenges Faced:**

- Struggled with understanding the difference between JSX and HTML, especially when it came to className vs class and camelCase attributes.
- Had difficulty setting up the initial project structure until I found a good template.
- Getting used to the component-based thinking pattern.

**Solutions:**

- Created a cheat sheet to help remember JSX differences from HTML.
- Used Vite to simplify the initial setup process.
- Practiced breaking UI into smaller component pieces on paper before coding.

### Day 2: **Working with Props**

**What I Learned:**

- Understood how to pass props to components.
- Practiced using props for dynamic content.
- Explored prop types and default props.

**Challenges Faced:**

- Took some time to grasp the concept of props being read-only and how to properly pass them down.
- Initially confused about the direction of data flow with props.
- Struggled with organizing component folders/files efficiently.

**Solutions:**

- Drew diagrams illustrating prop flow between components to visualize the data direction better.
- Created simple parent-child component examples to practice prop passing.
- Reorganized my project into a topics-based structure for better learning organization.

## Completed Projects

Here are the small projects I've built as I learn:

1. **Project 1: Basic Component Structure** _(Completed on Day 1)_

   - Created my first homepage component with static content.
   - [View Code](/src/topics/01-components/Homepage.jsx)
   - **Key Challenges:**
     - Understanding the component structure
     - Getting comfortable with JSX syntax

2. **Project 2: Props Example** _(In Progress)_
   - Building a component that accepts and displays different props.
   - **Goals:**
     - Practice passing various data types as props
     - Create reusable components
